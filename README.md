# ARK-Invest-Roku-Valuation-Model

ARK Invest's Roku Valuation Model, Published July 7, 2022.

We publish our open-source Roku model to strengthen the quality of our research. By sharing our assumptions and modeling methodologies, we hope to solicit constructive feedback and criticism. Like open-source software, we believe that open-source research will be more robust and accurate than research conducted and published non-transparently behind closed doors.

In this file, you can investigate the assumptions (e.g., values in red), criteria and methodology used in this valuation model to determine the value of a single security in five years. The model is inherently limited by its nature, including the assumption of perfectly efficient markets. ARK has used its research to determine what it believes are reasonable ranges for variables modelled as well as which business lines will have the biggest determination on the security’s future value. The model is designed to forecast the price of a single security over time. Please refer to the [Roku blog] for additional information on the assumptions, criteria and methodology used, and the limitations of this model. This model relies on historical information of the modelled security, including publicly available financial data sources, and analysis of that data by ARK and by third-parties, combined with ARK’s research to forecast over a five year time horizon. Please note that key inputs are included in the Roku Valuation and TAM tabs of this GitHub document. The reader is urged to use extreme caution when considering the forecasted performance, as it is inherently subjective and reflects ARK’s long term positive view of the company. There is no guarantee that any results will align with the forecasted performance, and they might not be predictive. This model is intended to analyze a single security, and we note that other investments were not considered that may have characteristics similar or superior to those being analyzed. This model generates outcomes that are hypothetical in nature.

While ARK’s current assessment of the subject company may be positive, please note that it may be necessary for ARK to liquidate or reduce position sizes prior to the company attaining any indicated valuation prices due to a variety of conditions including, but not limited to, client specific guidelines, changing market conditions, investor activity, fundamental changes in the company’s business model and competitive landscape, headline risk, and government/regulatory activity.  Additionally, ARK does not have investment banking or consulting relationship with the subject company.
